	<h2>About &lsquo;Dress-Up Ian&rsquo;</h2>
	
	<p>It has been an incredible year and we'd love to share some of the highlights with you.</p>

	<h3>Two year anniversary</h3>
	
	<p>In an effort to save money and explore our town's culture, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/awayken/sets/72157623234679448/">we enjoyed a 'staycation'</a> in Sioux Falls to celebrate our two-year wedding anniversary on January 26. When asked to comment, Holli replied, "<a href="http://www.milesrauschfamily.com/2010/01/26/anniversary-staycation/">My overall rating of the weekend: 4.5</a>."</p>

	<h3>Ian arrives</h3>

	<p>Our son, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/holli_joi/sets/72157623854063505/">Ian Greggory Rausch</a>, was <a href="http://www.milesrauschfamily.com/2010/05/08/introducing-ian-greggory-rausch/">born on April 30 at 1:29 PM</a>. He weighed 6 lbs. 11 oz. and measured at 20.5 in. Commenting on this accomplishment, Ian said, "Wah!"</p>

	<h3>Ian is baptized</h3>

	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/holli_joi/sets/72157624045469525/">Ian was baptized</a> at St. Lambert's Church in Sioux Falls on May 29. It was witnessed by godparents Bryce Rausch (uncle) and Sue Rausch (great-aunt), along with family.</p>

	<h3>Rausch Reunion</h3>

	<p>Joining Steve and Nancy Rausch and Lorin and Mary Brass, we co-organized <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/holli_joi/sets/72157624485754502/">the 2010 Rausch Reunion</a> in Sioux Falls over Independence Day weekend. Over 150 Rausches attended the weekend of golf, disc golf and general awesomeness. When asked to comment on the undertaking, the whole group agreed, "We worked well together because none of us are siblings."</p>

	<h3>One year</h3>

	<p>Holli celebrated her one year anniversary as graphic designer for the University of Sioux Falls in August.</p>

	<h3>Ian becomes a dinosaur</h3>

	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/holli_joi/sets/72157625246271508/">Ian's first Halloween</a> also included his first Halloween party, with baby friends Emerson and Evan. If only for one evening, Ian got to live out his (dad's) life-long dream of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JurTtqnwcvw">becoming a dinosaur</a>.</p>

	<h3>Jackson is born</h3>

	<p>Our first nephew and Ian's first cousin, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/holli_joi/sets/72157625538481734/">Jackson Glenn Gregg</a>, was born on November 24 to Holli's brother and sister-in-law, Adam and Cari. When asked how he felt about his baby cousin, Ian exclaimed, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amkDVZ1ARak">Na nana ba na daaada da</a>."</p>

	<h3>Thanksgiving</h3>

	<p>Spent at the Rausch household, we gave thanks for baby boys on Thanksgiving. Ian, unsolicited, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goKZ4eW_1ls">blew a raspberry</a>.</p>

	<h3>Three years</h3>

	<p>Miles will celebrate three years with Lawrence and Schiller at the end of December. He is a web developer. When asked for a comment, Miles responded, "No comment."</p>
