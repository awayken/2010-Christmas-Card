# 2010 Christmas Card

It’s been an incredible 2010, and one little guy played a big part in that. Probably the biggest update to our lives in the past calendar year has been our son, Ian Greggory Rausch. Born on April 30th, Ian’s been through three seasons and a whole lot of outfit changes.

With a new baby in tow this Christmas, we’ve been so busy preparing for this special memory, that we forgot to dress Ian for our Christmas photo! Will you help us dress Ian? Choose from outfits based on real life events and lovingly illustrated for your enjoyment! Take some time to read about our year (and outfits), and thanks for playing!
